# B.A.S.T.A.R.D - Boldly Analyzing and Strategizing Trade Algorithm for Radical Dividends

The Bastard trading algorithm employs a unique programming technique utilizing Object-oriented principles for evaluating each company. In this approach, every company is treated as a three-dimensional object, mirroring the structure of the modern world. The object representation encompasses essential dimensions, providing a comprehensive view for analysis:

- **Height**: Represents a vertical measure, indicating the magnitude or strength of the company in the market.
- **Width**: Represents a horizontal measure, symbolizing the company's reach and breadth of influence.
- **Length**: Represents the extension of the company's impact over time, considering historical trends and performance.
- **Depth**: Reflects the depth of the company's operations and market penetration.
- **Volume**: Signifies the overall quantity and intensity of the company's activities and transactions.
- **Displacement**: Represents the movement or shift in the company's position within the market.

This 3D representation forms the basis for a four-dimensional (4D) analysis, incorporating time as a crucial dimension. The interplay of these dimensions allows for a nuanced understanding of the company's strength and its effects on the broader market.

In the realm of 4D analysis, the Bastard algorithm explores the correlation between different companies. Each company's 4D characteristics create a dynamic landscape, where the height, width, length, depth, volume, and displacement of one object can have a profound impact on another. This correlation isn't limited to a linear relationship; instead, it involves complex, multidimensional interactions.

The algorithm goes beyond conventional linear correlations and explores the fascinating concept of "hallucination of relationships." This refers to the instances where seemingly unrelated companies exhibit correlations due to underlying market dynamics, creating illusions of interconnectedness. The Bastard algorithm is designed to detect and analyze these hallucinated relationships, providing a deeper understanding of market intricacies.

In-depth computations for each of these characteristics enable the algorithm to build an accurate model, providing insights into various aspects of the company's performance and potential. The holistic approach of the Bastard algorithm aims to capture the intricacies of the market dynamics and make informed trading decisions.
