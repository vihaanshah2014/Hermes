# H.E.R.M.E.S.
**High-frequency Execution & Risk Management Engine for Multi-asset Strategies**

Below is a **breakdown** of the **non-concurrent Python code** that demonstrates how H.E.R.M.E.S. implements a **3D-based object representation** of companies, extended into **4D** analysis through time. Each major step is explained so you can see how the system interprets market data, applies Bayesian updates, and generates final results.

## 1. JSON Loading

**Key Functions**  
- `load_json_file(filepath)`: Reads a JSON file (e.g., `djia.json` or `nasdaq.json`) containing corporations.  
- `fetch_all_symbols_from_jsons(djia_json_path, nasdaq_json_path)`: Combines two JSON sources into a single, deduplicated list of `(symbol, name)` pairs.

**Purpose**  
- **Why**: We need a flexible way to load lists of companies from external sources.  
- **Process**: 
  1. Parse each file to extract `symbol` and `name`.  
  2. Merge into a single dictionary to remove duplicates.  
  3. Return a consolidated list of all unique stock symbols for analysis.

## 2. Bayesian Forced-Close Logic

### `bayesian_update(...)`
- **What**: Implements a simple Bayesian update on the **prior mean** and **prior variance** given new observed vs. predicted prices.  
- **Why**: In H.E.R.M.E.S., each day’s “error” (observed - predicted) refines our belief about the asset’s returns.  
- **How**: 
  1. Combines `prior_variance` and `likelihood_variance` to form `posterior_variance`.  
  2. Computes `posterior_mean` by weighting prior and new error.  
  3. Clamps extremes (`np.clip(...)`) to avoid runaways.

### `predict_next_price(current_price, prior_mean)`
- **What**: Predicts next day’s price as `current_price * (1 + prior_mean)`.  
- **Why**: Each symbol’s daily return is approximated by this mean.  

### `trading_simulation_close_positions(...)`
- **What**: The **forced-close** simulation that each day:  
  1. Closes any existing position (long or short).  
  2. Decides whether to go long, go short, or hold based on the updated Bayesian predicted price vs. current price.  
  3. Evaluates the portfolio value at the end of each day, checking for bust (<= 0).  
- **Why**: Models a strategy that resets positions daily, helping manage risk and capture short-term signals.  
- **Key Steps**:  
  1. **Day-by-Day** iteration over `prices_df`.  
  2. **Compute** predicted price via `predict_next_price(...)`.  
  3. **Close** existing position at `observed_price`.  
  4. **Open** new position if `predicted_price` > or < `current_price`.  
  5. **Update** portfolio value, check bust, and do a **Bayesian update**.

## 3. Worker Function (No Concurrency)

**`process_symbol(sym, start_date, end_date)`**  
- **What**: For a single symbol:  
  1. Downloads daily price data (via `yfinance` or another source).  
  2. Checks if we have enough data.  
  3. Computes **Buy & Hold** final capital.  
  4. Runs the **forced-close** simulation to get final capital.  
  5. Returns a dict summarizing status (`OK`, `BUST`, `NO_DATA`, etc.) and final values.  

- **Why**: Simplifies the main loop so each symbol’s logic is self-contained.

---

## 4. Main Script Flow

1. **Gather symbols** from JSON (`djia.json` + `nasdaq.json`).  
2. **For** each symbol (sequentially, no concurrency):  
   - Print minimal progress.  
   - Call `process_symbol(...)` to get final results.  
3. **Write** everything to `output.txt`:  
   - Each line logs symbol, start/end dates, buy-hold result, forced-close result.  
   - Summarize how many were `OK`, `BUST`, `NO_DATA`, or `ERROR`.  
4. **Generate** a condensed console summary of how forced-close compares to buy-hold, and optionally produce a brief chart or list of top winners/losers.

## Notes on the 3D & 4D Aspects

- **3D Object** Representation:  
  - Height (market strength), Width (reach), Length (historical trajectory), Depth (operational depth), Volume (transaction scale), Displacement (positional changes).  
- **Time** as a **4th Dimension**:  
  - Observes how these 3D characteristics evolve day-to-day.  
  - Bayesian updates track shifting signals, unveiling “hallucinated” correlations that might not appear in simpler linear approaches.

---

## Summary of Key Files

- **`djia.json` / `nasdaq.json`**: Input data sources listing corporate symbols.  
- **`main.py`** :  
  - Loads JSON  
  - Executes the forced-close or buy-hold logic  
  - Produces final logs & summary  
- **`config.yml`** (optional): Could house thresholds, Bayesian parameters, or data feed settings.

## Future Enhancements

- **Concurrency** or **Parallel** execution for high-volume symbol sets.  
- **More Complex** Bayesian updates (e.g., hierarchical models).  
- **Machine Learning** modules for advanced signal detection.  
- **Integration** with real-time feeds (e.g., broker/exchange APIs).
- **Fees** by adding a cost to trade to emphasize making a decision
